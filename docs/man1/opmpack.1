.SH NAME
opmpack \- Validator and printer of deck in Eclipse files without comments
.SH DESCRIPTION
opmpack: invalid option \fB\-\-\fR 'h'
.PP
The opmpack program will load a deck, resolve all include
files and then print it out again on stdout. All comments
will be stripped and the value types will be validated.
.PP
By passing the option \fB\-o\fR you can redirect the output to a file
or a directory.
.PP
Print on stdout:
.TP
opmpack
\fI\,/path/to/case/CASE.DATA\/\fP
.PP
Print MY_CASE.DATA in /tmp:
.IP
opmpack \fB\-o\fR \fI\,/tmp\/\fP /path/to/MY_CASE.DATA
.PP
Print NEW_CASE in cwd:
.IP
opmpack \fB\-o\fR NEW_CASE.DATA path/to/MY_CASE.DATA
.PP
As an alternative to the \fB\-o\fR option you can use \fB\-c\fR; that is equivalent to \fB\-o\fR \-
but restart and import files referred to in the deck are also copied. The \fB\-o\fR and
\fB\-c\fR options are mutually exclusive.
